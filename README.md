## 📦 Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   - Open your terminal and clone the project to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Youssefawzy/react-video-player
     ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   - Once cloned, move into the project folder:
     ```bash
     cd react-video-player
     ```

3. **Install Lumen dependencies**:
   - Ensure that PHP and Composer are installed. Install the backend (Lumen) dependencies:
     ```bash
     composer install
     ```

4. **Install React dependencies**:
   - Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed. Install the frontend (React) dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

5. **Run the application (React and Lumen together)**:
   - To start both the Lumen backend and the React frontend simultaneously, use:
     ```bash
     npm run dev:both
     ```
   - This will start the React frontend on `http://localhost:3000` and the Lumen backend on `http://localhost:8000`.


6. **Run Lumen standalone**:
   - To only run the Lumen backend:
     ```bash
     npm run lumen
     ```

Now you’re all set up to run the project locally!
